Project Description:
SpaceXâ€™s reusable Falcon 9 first stage significantly reduces launch costs, making it a key differentiator in the commercial space industry. Predicting the success of first stage landings is essential for estimating launch pricing and overall mission cost efficiency. This project leverages public SpaceX data and machine learning techniques to forecast whether a Falcon 9 first stage will be successfully recovered.

Key Questions:

Will the first stage land successfully?

What factors affect first stage recovery?

How accurate are the predictive models?

How can predictions help optimize launch pricing?
